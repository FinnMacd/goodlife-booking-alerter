Goodlife Booking Alerter is an automated bot that will check Goodlife Fitness for booking time slots and check whether they are available or not. 
In order to use GBA, your account must first be logged in using the program in order to check for time slots. GBA uses the following libraries and are packaged into the JAR:

- Selenium3
- gson for json parsing
- apache commons io (previously)
- javafx 

TO-DO:

- Instead of freezing the Controller while the webdriver loads the page, implement a separate thread for the driver so that the Controller does not hang while it loads.
